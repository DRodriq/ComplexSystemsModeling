## Modeling Framework for Complex Systems ##

This project was created as a framework for the modeling and analysis of complex systems. Support only currently exists for iterative maps.

## Example Functions ##

Equations are taken from ["Introduction to the Modeling and Analysis of Complex Systems"](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/233)
by [Hiroki Sayaman](https://bingdev.binghamton.edu/sayama/).
       
## Getting Started ##
* Checkout the Repo
* Open an example file. Each example has two different functions that can be modeled
    - Choose the function you want to run and provide it to the run() function as a parameter
    - Run the program and observe the results

## Development Roadmap ##
* Implement initial value sweeping (In Progress)
* Implement methods for finding and visualizing equilibrium points
* Add benchmarking and logging hooks
* Extend unit test coverage
